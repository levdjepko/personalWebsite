        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p>I'm an aspiring software developer
          with knowledge of different modern tools
           and frameworks, including C#, Javascript,
           React, Bootstrap, ASP.NET. I love to get a
           deep knowledge of any subject and to get to
           a point where I love the result. I have an
           addiction to that feeling when software I
           build compiles, works and behaves as expected!</p>

          <h3>Software Development</h3>
          <p>I love solving problems by writing code. It seems like you get superpowers
          anytime you involved in scripting, putting tags and methods together to achieve the result.
        I haven't tried all possible languages and technologies, yet it is hard to remember all the stuff that I use or tried
      to play with. Most commonly used though are C# and .NET, Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap.</p>

          <h3>Web-development</h3>
          <p>Development of the websites is an importnat part of my skillset. From vanilla HTML,
            CSS to more advanced JavaScript to modern frameworks like React.
          Also, creating web applications with Microsoft technologies is an important part
        of my developer skillset.</p>

          <p>I spend significant amount of time every day to improve my skills.
          From writing the code to listening to the podcasts to learning about new technologies.
        This way I stay up-to-date with current events in development world, know about the trends like Cloud computing, containers, Docker and Kubernetes, Artificial intelligence,

          <h3>Working with data</h3>
          <p>Data analysis, extraction, transformation, loading, and all kinds of working with the data is very important in development.
          I love connecting the applications with back-end data and tools.</p>
